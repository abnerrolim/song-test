    <h2 class="release_page_header">Biography</h2>
    Born into a poor, strict, but gifted family of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, the infant Jackson&#39;s skills as a novelty soul-pop singer led his father to assemble a stage act around him and his brothers. <a title="[Artist7756]"  href="/artist/jackson_5" class="artist">Jackson 5</a> were picked up by <a title="[Label142]" href="/label/motown_records/" class="label">Motown Records</a> in 1969 and had a string of pop-chart number-one singles. Jackson&#39;s early solo records &#34;<a title="[Album126665]" href="/release/single/michael-jackson/got-to-be-there-maria-you-were-the-only-one/" class="album">Got to Be There</a>&#34;, &#34;<a title="[Album126667]" href="/release/single/michael-jackson/rockin-robin-love-is-here-and-now-youre-gone/" class="album">Rockin&#39; Robin</a>&#34; and &#34;<a title="[Album126669]" href="/release/single/michael-jackson/ben-you-can-cry-on-my-shoulder/" class="album">Ben</a>&#34; were critically acclaimed and commercially successful, but his solo career on Motown ended in 1975, when he signed to <a title="[Label177]" href="/label/epic_records/" class="label">Epic</a>.
    <br />
    <br />Jackson&#39;s debut album on his new label was a career-reviving smash as well as an indicator of things to come. <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album2448]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/off-the-wall-4/" class="album">Off the Wall</a></em>, produced by <a title="[Artist4069]"  href="/artist/quincy-jones" class="artist">Quincy Jones</a>, was a tight collection of funky pop ballads, two of which became number one hits. Jackson collaborated with Jones again on his 1982 album, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album1990]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/thriller-3/" class="album">Thriller</a></em>, which eventually became the biggest selling studio album in history (which by 2006 was being quoted as having sold over 100,000,000 copies.). <em class="rymfmt">Thriller</em> also revolutionized the music-video industry with its inventive, high-budget videos for the singles &#34;<a title="[Album67876]" href="/release/single/michael-jackson/thriller-things-i-do-for-you/" class="album">Thriller</a>&#34; and &#34;<a title="[Album67875]" href="/release/single/michael-jackson/beat-it-get-on-the-floor/" class="album">Beat It</a>&#34;. The album actually spawned seven hit singles (out of nine overall album tracks).
    <br />
    <br />With his newly-acquired astronomical wealth, Jackson purchased the rights to <a title="[Artist8]"  href="/artist/the-beatles" class="artist">The Beatles</a>&#39; songwriting back catalogue (an investment worth several hundred million dollars). His long-awaited follow-up to <em class="rymfmt">Thriller</em>, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album2449]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/bad-7/" class="album">Bad</a></em> arrived in 1987 and produced four number one singles, but sold less than a quarter of the number of copies of its predecessor. Still, the <em class="rymfmt">Bad</em> tour generated enormous interest and revenues, and Jackson ended the 1980s as a celebrated, world-conquering superstar.
    <br />
    <br />Although the &#39;90s began on a relatively positive note for Jackson, he would never again regain the critical or commercial heights of his &#39;80s heyday. His fourth studio album on Epic, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album2450]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/dangerous/" class="album">Dangerous</a></em>, was knocked off the number one spot by <a title="[Artist37]"  href="/artist/nirvana" class="artist">Nirvana</a>&#39;s sophomore album, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album126]" href="/release/album/nirvana/nevermind/" class="album">Nevermind</a></em>, but still sold over 30 million albums world wide. A retrospective 2-disc set, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album2451]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/history-past-present-and-future-book-i-2/" class="album">HIStory: Past, Present &amp; Future</a></em> offered hits from the past, as well as new material which sees Jackson at his most angry and emotional. His final release of the 1990s, <em class="rymfmt"><a title="[Album3558]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/blood-on-the-dance-floor-history-in-the-mix-1/" class="album">Blood on the Dance Floor</a></em>, features five original cuts followed by remixes of songs from the aforementioned album. It was poorly critically received but remains the best selling remix album to ever be released.
    <br />
    <br />In 2001, Jackson emerged once more from an increasingly airtight existence in California with an unfairly over-anticipated new album. The release of <a title="[Album2452]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/invincible/" class="album">Invincible</a> was preempted by rumours of its staggering production costs (said to be $55 million), and the album was not well received by critics or the public.
    <br />
    <br />Despite having always courted media attention, Jackson eventually lost control of his carefully-guarded self-image. His last years were filled with tales of his increasingly bizarre escapades and money troubles. In 2003, child molestation charges were brought against Jackson, although he was never found guilty.
    <br />
    <br />He was booked to do a number of shows at <a title="[Venue3037]" href="/venue/the_o2_arena/" class="venue">The O2 Arena</a> in London during the summer of 2009. While described as a comeback of sorts, the name of the shows, <em class="rymfmt">This is It</em>, and hints from Jackson himself led many to believe that he might have been planning to retire. As the shows approached the promoter expanded the appearance to an unheard of 50 shows over 6 months, all of which quickly sold out. Unfortunately, the shows never happened as Jackson collapsed at a home in Los Angeles on June 25, 2009 and was pronounced dead later the same day at the UCLA Medical Center.
    <br />
    <br />Much like Jackson&#39;s life, his first posthumous album titled <a title="[Album3186806]" href="/release/album/michael-jackson/michael/" class="album">Michael</a>, was surrounded by controversy, largely because there was skepticism as to whether or not it was Jackson&#39;s voice on some of the songs from the album.
    <br />
    <br />&#39;&#39;People ask me how I make music. I tell them I just step into it. It&#39;s like stepping into a river and joining the flow. Every moment in the river has its song.&#39;&#39;
    <br />â€• Michael Jackson
